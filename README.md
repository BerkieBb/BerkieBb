# About Me

Hi, I'm Berkie, I currently develop for the [QBCore Framework](https://github.com/qbcore-framework) on the [FiveM](https://fivem.net) and [RedM](https://redm.net) platform, all of the repositories on my page are free resources I have created or edited, I do most of my developing for free but if you want to donate to me you can always [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BerkieB)!
